# GalleryBuilder

This is a Java application that reads (Gallery)[http://galleryproject.org/] directories and builds HTML for (Galleria)[https://galleria.io/] static gallery web sites. A copy of the Galleria JavaScript is included. This JavaScript application is licensed under the MIT open source license.  This code will only work on Gallery directories (albums) that were built using Gallery 2. Gallery 2 uses local PHP code that references local files. Later versions of Gallery stored photos and metadata in a database (e.g., mySQL). This code will not build static galleries from these newer albums.

This code is for sophisticated users, preferably who understand Java code. It builds the HTML for a Galleria gallery, but you will still have to include this HTML on a web page for the gallery.

I wrote this code for the Galleria Folio gallery. This gallery is not open source and is licensed software.

For many years I hosted my personal domain bearcave.com on a Linux web host. As time went on, they migrated my web site to new servers. Unfortunately this was done without any concern for the software that my web site needed (e.g., PHP to support the Gallery albums). This broke my web site and the galleries stoped functioning.

When I mentioned this to my web host, their response was (to put it in polite terms) "too bad for you". I'll note that I was paying my web host $35/months for this "service".
